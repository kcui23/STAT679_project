# STAT679 Project

Welcome to the STAT679 Project repository! In this project, we apply advanced visualization techniques learned in the STAT679 class to analyze and interpret various datasets, showcasing our growth in data science skills, particularly in data visualization.

## Project Overview

This project, rooted in the principles taught in STAT679, demonstrates how techniques from the class are directly applied to real-world data. We explore macroeconomic factors, company revenues, international trade influences, and the impact of news on stock prices through the lens of visualization.

## Project Background

Stock market data, often complex and voluminous, requires effective visualization for better understanding and analysis. This is a key concept we've honed in our STAT679 class. Our group has constructed a design studio on stock market data visualization, inspired by the visualization skills developed in the course. This studio serves stock managers and potential buyers, providing interactive visualization that connects stock trends with influencing factors such as Political and International Influence, Company Factors, News and Events, and Macro-economic variables. The datasets chosen reflect these categories, facilitating visualizations that answer critical questions posed in our STAT679 curriculum.
